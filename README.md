# Pig-Game
This repo contains Pig Game code
which is having simple user interface and easy to play. I hope you like It. 
Rules are very simple.
1. You are allowed to roll dice as many as times and score will get added but, if however 1 comes then you lose all score in that round.
2. You can roll and hold the score in order to avoid the loss of your previous score
3. The player who reaches 100 first would be a winner
